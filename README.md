# ML Major

This project will be made in Python, an extremely common language in Data Science and ML because it does so much of the ‘heavy lifting’ of programming.

There are two key aims of this project.

To inspire people to learn more about machine learning and some of the ways it’s present in our world
To help further someone’s education in the topic of ML by providing them with easy-to-use realtime simulations to show ML in practice
Briefly, a user will be able to select what type of machine learning they want to see, and then place that machine learning agent in an environment to see how well it performs. They will also be able to edit configurations to observe how agents behave.

The app will offer short write-ups on all types of machine learning and even pause simulations mid-run to highlight specific concepts, in an attempt to better educate the user.
