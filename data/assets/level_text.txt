Red Circles
Your job is simple. You have to filter the data from the 'Input' component and provide the correct samples to the 'Output' component. <new> <new> In this level, it's simply a case of connecting the two together and pressing play.

Red and Green Circles
Now you have to filter between the green and red circles. <new> <new> I've given you access to the naive bayes algorithm to get you started. <new> <new> P.S Make sure any unwanted samples are sent into the trash in order to end the level!

Let's Go Faster
You're going to have to sort out this data very quickly if you want to pass, you may even wonder if it's in fact possible. <new> <new> <new> ... Check out the shop ;)

3 Samples
Take note that some algorithms will struggle with more than 2 type of data

The Donut Problem
The donut problem creates an inner ring with one sample, and an outer ring with another sample <new> <new> This non-linearity is hard for some classifiers to handle

The XOR Problem
The XOR problem is another non-linear problem that lots of algorithms struggle to deal with. <new> <new> On the bright side, there's a big reward for completing this one :D

Lots of colours, see how well you can do! <new> <new> In this level, everyone's a winner! <new> <new> Also it's the last one :(
